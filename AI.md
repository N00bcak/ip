# AI Usage Summary

- **Date:** 2026-02-18
- **Specific AI Tool:** Github Copilot (GPT-5.1-Codex-Max)

- **Uses:**
  - Authored the Dooki user guide (docs/README.md) with command summaries, examples, and run instructions.
  - Adjusted Dooki error messaging and text-UI script; verified tests (gradlew test) and text UI regression (runtest.sh).

- **How It Was Prompted:**
    - For the user guide, I provided a structured outline of sections and key points to cover, then let Copilot generate the content based on that structure.
    - For code adjustments, I asked it to run the test script until no errors were found, and then I manually reviewed the generated code to ensure it met the requirements and fixed the issues faithfully.

- **Experiences:**
    - Documentation generated by Copilot was very minimalist and could use a little motivation and user-friendliness, but content-wise accurate while covering the bases of documentation.
    - Worth noting that simply asking for a "user guide" by copying the website's description was insufficient to get a clear user guide; light scaffolding was necessary in order to get the desired format from the AI tool.
    - Copilot's use of agents was able to effectively automate test verification procedures which saved considerable time in ensuring the text UI's correctness.
    - Unfortunately, it did not have the tools to interface with GUI applications like JavaFX, so I had to manually verify the GUI functionality and error handling.
- **I hereby confirm I followed the Git Standard**:
  - Once
  - Twice
